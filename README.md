# A-ML-based-survey-summarizer
This is a project from CAMH (https://www.camh.ca/) under the supervision of Dr.Jonathan Rose at the University of Toronto. The model is able to process a large piece of text, extracts the distributed topics (ideas) from the text and provides a brief summary under each topic extracted. The training data for this project is not released due to privacy issues. You can see a more detailed description of our project in the report.
